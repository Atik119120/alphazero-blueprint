# Product Requirements Document — AlphaZero BD

## 1. Vision
Build Bangladesh's most trusted bilingual creative-agency + learning platform where local students, entrepreneurs and businesses can hire the agency **and** learn its craft — all under one brand.

## 2. Mission
Deliver premium branding, web and marketing services while simultaneously teaching those same skills through a fully-featured LMS in Bangla and English.

## 3. Target Users
| Segment | Needs |
|---|---|
| Bangladeshi students & aspiring designers/developers | Affordable, native-language courses, certificates, community |
| Small businesses & entrepreneurs | Branding, web design, social-media assets |
| Freelance teachers | Platform to sell recorded/live courses with revenue share |
| Agency admins | Central CMS to run marketing site, LMS content, payments, communications |

## 4. Business Goals
- Combine service revenue (agency projects) with recurring LMS revenue.
- Retain platform independence from Lovable subscription (decoupled architecture).
- Scale to unlimited teachers/courses without engineering intervention.

## 5. Learning Goals
- Complete video courses with progression gates (90 %).
- Auto-issued certificates for paid courses.
- Threaded Q&A per lesson, teacher-student chat, thumbs feedback.

## 6. Problems Solved
- No trusted Bangla-first LMS with integrated local payments (bKash/Nagad via UddoktaPay).
- Agencies rarely offer both service delivery and skill training in one product.
- Course platforms in BD lack anti-piracy video controls.

Marketing site · CMS (Homepage, Footer, Landing, Hero, Services, Works, Team) · Auth (student/teacher/admin) · Course catalog · Direct enrollment + payment · Course viewer · Live classes · Chat & Notices · Support tickets · Certificates · Teacher earnings · Admin AI Assistant · Analytics.
