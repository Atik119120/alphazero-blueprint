# AlphaZero BD

A bilingual (Bangla / English) creative agency **and** learning-management platform built for **AlphaZero BD** (Rajshahi, Bangladesh). The public site markets the agency's services and portfolio; the `learn.*` sub-brand and `/student`, `/teacher`, `/admin` panels power a full LMS with paid enrollment, live and recorded classes, certificates, and revenue splits.

---

## Overview

AlphaZero is a two-in-one platform:

1. **Creative agency site** – logo, branding, UI/UX, web & social-media design services, team, works, contact.
2. **Learning platform (AlphaZero Learn)** – course catalog, checkout via UddoktaPay/bKash/Nagad, secured YouTube-based video player, live YouTube classes, comments/Q&A, feedback, certificates, teacher earnings, admin CMS.

Both experiences share one React SPA, one Supabase backend, and a language toggle that swaps every string, image, and route hero.

## Installation

```bash
bun install       # or: npm install
bun run dev       # Vite on http://localhost:8080
```

Requires Node ≥ 18 and a `.env` (see below). The Supabase backend is already provisioned by Lovable Cloud – no local Supabase needed.

---

## Environment Variables

All variables are **publishable** and live in project root `.env` (auto-managed by Lovable Cloud):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase Data API URL |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Anon / publishable key (RLS-protected) |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` | Project ref |

Server-only secrets (used by Edge Functions) are stored in Supabase Vault:
`CLOUDINARY_API_KEY/SECRET/CLOUD_NAME`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `UDDOKTAPAY_API_KEY`, `UDDOKTAPAY_BASE_URL`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`, `LOVABLE_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.

Never expose secrets client-side. See [`Security.md`](./Security.md).

---

## Build

```bash
bun run build         # production build → dist/
bun run build:dev     # dev-mode build
bun run preview       # serve dist/
bun run lint          # eslint
```

---

## Deployment

Frontend is deployed as a static SPA (Vercel / Netlify / Lovable hosting). Backend (Supabase) is provisioned and outlives any hosting subscription. See [`Deployment.md`](./Deployment.md).

Domains:
- Preview: `id-preview--<id>.lovable.app`
- Published: `alphazero00.lovable.app`
- Sub-brand: `learn.<domain>` triggers Learn variant of `/`, `/about`, `/contact`
